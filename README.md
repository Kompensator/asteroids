# asteroids
Simulating deflection of an asteroid on a collision course with Earth using lasers and other means.
Changes to Hackathon file:
- Physics simulation is running first and it's independent to FuncAnimation
- Useless printing is deleted
- Structural changes in main()

Future changes:
- Add theta calculation that allows a tangential or anti tangential burn
- Animate only a slice of the physics simulation
