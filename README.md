# asteroids
Simulating deflection of an asteroid on a collision course with Earth using lasers and other means.
Changes to Hackathon file:
- Physics simulation is running first and it's independent to FuncAnimation
- Useless printing is deleted
- Structural changes in main()
- Can now animate a slice of the simulation
- Weird angle bug is FIXED!! (there's some hardcoding to be done on line 96)

Upcoming changes:
- the ability to skip a certain number of frames to make animation run faster without compromising simulation
